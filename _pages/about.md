Hello! I am Hemaditya.

I am a computational scientist who is passionate about leveraging advanced computational techniques to solve complex scientific and engineering problems.
I have gained experience in designing and implementing algorithms, conducting data analysis, and developing physics-based models through my studies and PhD.
In my free time, I play ultimate frisbee competitively, experiment with new cooking recipes and explore Sci-Fi stories through my love for books.
